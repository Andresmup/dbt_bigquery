# BDT W/BIGQUERY

👋 Welcome to my repository where I use the ELT tool DBT to work with BigQuery.

🔥 Transforming and working with data stored in BigQuery using SQL. 🔥

## What's DBT?
![1_6i9ATn1vvRmLjxzj8UsZFg](https://github.com/Andresmup/dbt_bigquery/assets/77512331/656d49e9-5894-4a33-a249-dc890493343d)

DBT is a SQL-first transformation workflow that lets teams quickly and collaboratively deploy analytics code following software engineering best practices like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation

## Using the project

In dbt Cloud or dbt Core, the commands you commonly use are:
```sh
dbt run # Runs the models you defined in the project
dbt build # Builds and tests the selected resources such as models, seeds, snapshots, and tests
dbt test # Executes the tests defined for the project
```

## Project Code
In the folders my_files and models you can find the SQL queries.
