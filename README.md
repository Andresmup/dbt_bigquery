# BDT W/BIGQUERY

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my repository where I use the ELT tool DBT to work with BigQuery.

ðŸ”¥ Transforming and working with data stored in BigQuery using SQL. ðŸ”¥

## What's DBT?

DBT is a SQL-first transformation workflow that lets teams quickly and collaboratively deploy analytics code following software engineering best practices like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation

## Using the project

In dbt Cloud or dbt Core, the commands you commonly use are:
```sh
dbt run # Runs the models you defined in the project
dbt build # Builds and tests the selected resources such as models, seeds, snapshots, and tests
dbt test # Executes the tests defined for the project
```
